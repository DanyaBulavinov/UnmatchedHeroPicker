This project, named "UnmatchedHeroPicker", is a mobile application developed using Kotlin and Java. 
It is built with the Android Jetpack Compose UI toolkit and follows the Material Design guidelines.  
The application provides a user interface for selecting heroes from a predefined list. The list of heroes is defined in the DataSource.kt file and includes characters such as Achilles, Alice, Dr. Jekyll, Dracula, and many more. 
Each hero is represented by an ImageItem object, which includes the hero's name and dominant color.  
The main user interface is defined in the UnmatchedApp.kt file. It uses a variety of Compose components, including Scaffold, TopAppBar, DropdownMenu, and DropdownMenuItem. The application also includes a preview function, UnmatchedAppPreview, for visualizing the UI during development.  The project uses Gradle for build and dependency management. 
The settings.gradle.kts file configures the plugin and dependency resolution management, specifying Google's Maven repository, Maven Central, and the Gradle Plugin Portal as the sources for dependencies.
